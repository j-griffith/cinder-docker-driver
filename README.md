# Cinder Docker Driver


Docker Volume Plugin to enable consumption of OpenStack-Cinder Block Storage
with containers.

## Install

### Build From Source
Obviously you'll need to have a golang dev environment setup, one piece of that
includes the golang dep tool.  You can find install instructions and usage info
here:  https://github.com/golang/dep

For the most part just installing the tool is good enough, the Makefile will
take care of it's usage for you.

```shell
git clone https://github.com/j-griffith/cinder-docker-driver
cd cinder-docker-driver
make clean; make
sudo ./install.sh
```

NOTE the specification of the `source` argument to the install script, this
will result in the install script copying your locally built binary
(```./_bin/cdd```) into the install directory and creating the systemd file.

Omitting the `source` arg (or providing any other argument) will instruct the
installer to pull the latest release from github and installing it instead.

### Just the bits
Use curl to download and run the install script in the package Github repo::

```shell
curl -sSl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/j-griffith/cinder-docker-driver/master/install.sh | sudo sh
```
## Configuration options
Example config.json file:

```json
{
  "Endpoint": "http://172.16.140.145:5000/v2.0",
  "Username": "Fred",
  "Password": "FredsPassWord",
  "TenantID": "979ddb6183834b9993954ca6de518c5a",
  "Region": "RegionOne"
}
```
V3 Endpoints work as well, but we require one additional piece of information
(DomainName).  If you specify a V3 endpoint, and no DomainName in your config,
the driver will attempt to auth with a DomainName = "Default", if your
DomainName is set to something other than this though, you'll need to specify
it in your config file.  Here's an example of a V3 config:

```json
{
  "Endpoint": "http://172.16.140.145/identity/v3",
  "Username": "Fred",
  "Password": "FredsPassWord",
  "TenantID": "979ddb6183834b9993954ca6de518c5a",
  "Region": "RegionOne"
  "DomainName": "MyAuthDomain",
}
```

### Minimal/Required Config
Configuration options are stored in json format in config.json, the minimum required options provide just enough info to connect to our Cinder API and execute commands.  Note that for quick demos and just trying things out you can use the default interface and network for your iSCSI connections, it's highly recommended however you don't do this if you want to do anything that might require some performance.

- Endpoint
- Username
- Password
- TenantID

### Additonal/Optional Config

- DefaultVolSz (1 GiB)
- MountPoint (/var/lib/cinder/mount)
- InitiatorIFace (default)
- HostUUID (root disk UUID)
- InitiatorIP (default interface IP)
- Region (defaults to "RegionOne")

Example config with additional options:

```json
{
  "Endpoint": "http://172.16.140.145:5000/v2.0",
  "Username": "Fred",
  "Password": "FredsPassWord",
  "TenantID": "979ddb6183834b9993954ca6de518c5a",
  "DefaultVolSz": 1,
  "MountPoint": "/mnt/cvols",
  "InitiatorIFace": "/dev/eth4",
  "HostUUID": "219b0670-a214-4281-8424-5bb3be109ddd",
  "InitiatorIP": "192.168.4.201"
}
```
## Start the daemon
If you want to just launch the driver daemon as root (or sudo):

```shell
sudo ./_bin/cdd >> /var/log/cdd.out 2>&1 &'
sudo service docker restart
```

## Using systemd
The install script includes creation of a systemd service file.
If you used the install script you can just add your config file
and use ```service cdd start```.

Otherwise, you can inspect the install.sh script and create/setup
your own systemd service file.

## Try it out
Assuming your credentials were all set correctly and the driver was able to start up without any issues, you should be ready to go.

To get a list of commands offered via the Docker Volume API:

```console
$ docker volume --help

Usage: 	docker volume COMMAND

Manage Docker volumes

Options:
      --help   Print usage

Commands:
  create      Create a volume
  inspect     Display detailed information on one or more volumes
  ls          List volumes
  rm          Remove a volume

Run 'docker volume COMMAND --help' for more information on a command.
```

To create a volume and specify some options like size and Cinder Type:

```console
$ docker volume create -d cinder --name fredsFirstDVol -o size=10 -o type=lvm-1
```

You can also just add the volume arguments to your docker run command and Docker will make the create calls for you.  Keep in mind that if the volume already exists we'll just grab it and try to attach it, if it doesn't, the Docker service will issue a request to the driver to create it.

## What's next
Put the whole thing in a container, and just run it from there.  Almost there,
just trying to figure out some details on how to use iscsid in a container and
have it effect the host.
